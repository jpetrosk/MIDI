# MIDI
An Experiment in MIDI and procedural generation (maybe)

The main goal is to be able to take a well structured text file containing chord symbols (ie/ Cmaj) and convert them to a properly formatted MIDI file that can be played in any General MIDI compatable synthasizer.

This serves a secondary, more challanging goal, of a program that can take a chord file input and produce a musically meaningful output.
